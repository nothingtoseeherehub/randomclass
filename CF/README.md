Goal for AWS and React JS
editted from container-ized toolset

Will want to repeat entire class and recreate via cloudformation to identify
automation potential and roadblocks

Now, attempt to redo the class with cloudformation
likely will run into things that will need to be scripted
possibly ansible, though secondary goal
Will likely need to create docker container
May need to update the dockerfile for my virtualos to contain the npm
test items and react16 components needed for testing and completing the class
